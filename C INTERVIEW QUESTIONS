What is a union?
The union is a user-defined data type that allows storing multiple types of data in asingle unit. However, it doesn't occupy the sum of the memory of all members. Itholds the memory of the largest member only.In union, we can access only one variable at a time as it allocates one commonspace for all the members of a union.
